Five tongli rich, does not make people forget it today the past sufferings.
Despite its watery city, convenient transportation, mild climate, fertile land, rich products, known as the "land of fish and rice" the laudatory name, but as the ancient land of Chinese civilization, it still can't avoid open switch and the influence of the whip and all who lived in ages past.
I from relevant departments in 1983 in wujiang editor understands history textbook, have several events in the history of wujiang region, and that several events must be on the account: that was in 1554 (Ming jiajing 33 years), wujiang magistrate of a county zhi in order to resist the Japanese yi Yang, organizing local rich he donated to build "watch tower".
The "watch tower", "ceramic wall covering its surface, rain not soak, while good solid";
Floor with riot police in garrison, found that the enemy can cast shows for the number.
Everyone who has studied history know that "manages to yi" is "the enemy";
"The enemy" is before the Meiji restoration, Japan, by Japanese feudal ZhuFan to expand overseas, organize some feudal lords, fallen warriors and rogues and smugglers, often armed plunder to China's coastal areas.
"Release", is China's ancient old name of Japan;
"Coach", is refers to such a group of pirate.
Since 1369, the enemy to invade our country unceasingly coastal cities and regions, "killing people, wealth, of capture, are suffering from the seacoast."
The enemy in the robbery "captive and the sea" in young adults, "and tied the Qiang robe of baby sling on the bamboo", "depending on the crow, clap laugh le".
In some places was reduced after strikes "integrated skeleton as ling, bleeding narikawa".
So when the spring of 1554 in February, wujiang magistrate of a county that the enemy LinLai attack again, he manages to lure thief entry, then ambush fighters.
This is the first time in the struggle of wujiang people illustrious.
The second is 1862, another jiangnan February weather.
The king of the taiping heavenly kingdom zhong political launched a second fight against Shanghai.
In wujiang tongli, li was dominated by taiping rebels, reed market, Jiang Zhen, has become a base areas behind the taiping rebels.
In tongli town, known as the "bridge in treasure," said the "Pacific bridge" of the three bridge, is that tongli villagers for support the taiping rebels fighting testimony.
The bridge still has a pair of "magpie" immediately stone chisel signet.
Starting in February this year, taiping rebels regime battle lasted four months, a total of more than 3000 Chinese and foreign reactionary forces annihilation, and more than 10000 members of the taiping rebels in wujiang.
Although the revolution of the taiping heavenly kingdom movement finally failed, but followed later the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal the colonization of the new democratic revolution, but after the fall of victory in one hundred.
And on February 21, 1942, when the big NianChuQi, more than one thousand Japanese troops from the stronghold of suzhou, wujiang, jiaxing, points RuanQingYuan kuomintang troops.
Because nguyen evacuation, the Japanese could not find opponent, then to Wu Jiangshen tower, reed market, founded several areas for people to kill.
They killed the imprisoned the collective;
On 12 mayor, BaoChang all strung together, with a motorized boats sink float to the pit in the collective water drowned;
Don't hand over to treat nguyen department to villagers, is not alive to choose death, bayonets is blanching death;
Either the villagers throw into the boiling water pot boiled alive;
Some were mounted on three shelf burn to death;
Some pulled out alive;
A villager is used in the red-hot iron chain into its cotton-padded clothes, immediately flames, flesh cheep crack, its shape is horrible;
Finally, some villagers could not ask what, after the Japanese become angry from embarrassment, the captain a wave of his hand, devils picked up one by one under the bayonet toward the crowd rushed in, immediately shrieks a regional accents, dropped, terrified.
In the kingdom of wu villagers land, deep red blood flow.
Spring this year, the Japanese invaders in the holocaust wujiang region, a total of 2373 Chinese were villagers LuSha.
These to have the witness of the living, the living word recorded, to war criminals has a history of war criminals confessed crimes, that is real Chinese people never forget the history of the one hundred one thousand.
Even after five hundred years in three hundred, the Chinese people still remember this period of history of anger.
Why is that?
Because it is a history, because it is not optional rewrite, and reigned write or distort history, it is all in the process of a civilized society has a history of contact and absolutely can not be cut off.
I recently read on the Internet, however, have a paragraph of text, so I put it down was quoted as saying: "in the Oriental buddhist country, cultured is compassion and tolerance, even if you killed people, as long as you put down the knife, you can site buddhahood, so social culture called on everyone to forgive look forward of the east, ago, is a history, even if the!
...
Japanese, Chinese.
Recall our "unprecedented" of the "cultural revolution", ten million people died, does anyone ever open out apology? Excuse me, someone open out responsibility?
...
We never to your own mistakes and guilt for public confession and reflection.
Under the same religion and culture of other ethnic groups (the author) refers to the Japan, how (note) of the Chinese - quotation to you sincere apology?
...
We called the "cultural revolution" work on the mistakes and errors, and called the war of aggression in the history of Japanese 'question' how similar!
The mainstream culture of the two countries are surprisingly consistent, no one think that it is a crime, even if the 'individuals' guilty, has received a just punishment;
China's "the gang of four", Japan's 'the hideki tojo and so on.
So, we don't have to apologize for "the gang of four", the Japanese also no need to apologize for 'the hideki tojo!
So, let's forget the past!
We forget the history!
We look forward!
I here quoted text post title is "let's make an example for the Japanese?"
(press to have Shi Zhongwen essays observatory, February 9, 2006, the author: a careless person).
See such words, someone debunking said: "thought you (no one) was a scholar, fledgling, until saw you some articles, found you not mind, but conscious confusing concept", "heartless people can be summed up in two words" scum ", in the nation's national scum, is a shame to intellectuals in the intellectuals, in a man is a man of scum, and so on."
"See you (unintentionally) in another post to defend Japanese militarism, just discover oneself is a woman's soft nature,...
Your view of the world is not generally need to transform the kind of world view."
(see stay bullies: back unintentionally people stick, February 24, 2006, yi Shi Zhongwen essays observatory).
Stay bully, I think the tone is too modest.
For this kind of like a 30-40 s of last century "traitors" literature phenomenon, in the 21st century, incredibly someone clap their hands for a traitor literature, called "traitors literature" has a number of "soft bone spirit", have the spirit of "affair", but the spirit can be also used for national salvation "curve", etc., its absurdity as a careless person how?
What I think, the fallacy comes from logic and purpose?
Of course, I don't want to put this historical phenomenon debate today I go to dispute a barge, in this article I just want to "against" unintentionally"
Five, the mei-yu abuse people hobby.
